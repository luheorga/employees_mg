# Employees API

ASP NET Core API with SPA middleware for Angular 7 APP, i choose the SPA Middleware for simplicity.

# Get Started

To get started clone or download the repo and run MasGlobal.Employees.API in visual studio 2017+, the first time you run the solution, it could be slow becouse it have to download the required node modules for angular app.

# Requirements

- .Net Core 2.2.107 (compatible with visual studio 2017), [Get .Net Core SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/thank-you/dotnet-sdk-2.2.107-windows-x64-installer)
- Node js 8+, [Get NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/dist/v10.16.0/node-v10.16.0-x64.msi)
- [Angular CLI](https://cli.angular.io/) 7+, to install run `npm install @angular/cli`

# TODO
- Add better exception handling in server and client
- Move ApiUrl from EmployeesAPIRepository.cs to AppSettings.json
