# Employees API

ASP NET Core API with SPA middelware for Angular 7 APP, i choose the SPA Middleware for simplicity.


# Get Started

To get started clone or download the repo and run MasGlobal.Employees.API in visual studio 2017+, the first time you run the solution must be slowly becouse it have to download the required node modules for angular app.

# Requiremets

- Node js 8+, [Get NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/dist/v10.16.0/node-v10.16.0-x64.msi)
